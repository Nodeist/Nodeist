We operate highly secure, fast and stable validator nodes for many mainnet and testnet blockchains managed by experienced professionals. We have been operating validator nodes since June 2020 and gained valuable experience in these 2 years. We also provide the following contributions to the Ecosystem.

1. We publish technical trainings on our Youtube channel for the community.
2. We regularly provide Snapshots for both Mainnets and TestNets.
3. We are in the process of launching IBC Relays across many cosmos blockchains. We are already running an IBC Relayer on testnets.
4. As we expand our activities, we will provide more valuable services to the community.


## Security precautions

We have set the following security measures for all our Validator Nodes.

1. Firewall - We reject all incoming traffic except a few important ports like 26656.
2. Hardware, we connected SSH Key Authentication to login to server (.pem). No one can log in without these keys.
3. We have removed the default SSH port 22 and are using another port for SSH.
4. We removed SSH login using root password (root-pass).
5. IP Lock - SSH login is only allowed from 1 main IP and temporary access to another IP is allowed during travel.
6. We run dedicated powerful servers for all our nodes with NVMe SSD. A few settings have been specially updated for the best performance on the server. We regularly check and update for new updates for the operating system.
7. Fully synchronized Backup server (even for Kujira Testnet) and if main server is down, we can switch to backup server in 5 minutes.
